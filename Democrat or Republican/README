This project is to build a classifier that will predict whether a person is a Democrat or a
Republican depending on their Twitter posts. 

project1.py contains 4 models: 
Multinomial Naive Bayes Unigram, Logistic Regression Bigram,  
Multinomial Naive Bayes Trigram, and Best train model. 

It prints out accuracy, top 20 features, and confusion matrix for each model. 
To use the test file to run the code, please replace 'dev_newline.txt' with test file name in line 29 and 30.

classify.py file takes the train and test files as command line arguments.
Type ‘python classify.py train_newline.txt test_newline.txt (or whatever the test file name is)’ to run. 

It saves best trained model to model.pkl, post-processed vectorized test data to test.pkl,
and CountVectorizer to features.pkl. (Will load features.pkl to get top 20 features in analyze.py file)

analyze.py file takes the best trained model and verctorized test data as command line arguments.

Type 'python analyze.py model.pkl test' to run. It outputs top 20 features, confusion matrix,
and confusion matrix plot for the best trained model.
